# CodeChallengeFlatdango

## Description 
The flatdango movie app allows people to buy tickets for different movies.
The application uses a patch for the fetch api. The patch method enables the data 
to persist. The app also uses preventDefault() to ensure the page does not refresh when 
loadeed. The application also appends the data fetched from the json server as a list.
